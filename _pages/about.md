Hi! Iâ€™m Alina, a fifth-year PhD student at Columbia University advised by [Colin Hill](http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~jch/) and [Zoltan Haiman](http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~zoltan/). I work on various topics in physical cosmology, both theory and data analysis. My current research is primarily focused on extracting non-Gaussian information from cosmological data and CMB spectral distortions. 

Prior to Columbia, I was a [Thomas J. Watson](https://watson.foundation/fellowships/tj) fellow in 2019-2020 and graduated from Colgate University in 2019. I grew up in Astana and Almaty in Kazakhstan and came to the U.S. for the first time when I was 13 to study at a high school in Waimea, Hawaii (just a short drive from the Mauna Kea!). 

Outside of research, you are most likely to find me either [reading](https://forms.gle/CYqc6vCWa8JNz2TX9) or running. I also love dancing, creative writing, and playing tennis.

Please feel free to contact me via: as6131 [at] columbia [dot] edu
