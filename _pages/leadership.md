Below are some activities that I have been involved in outside of research and teaching:

## National Osterbrock Leadership Program (NOLP)
I was selected for the 2021-2023 cohort of NOLP fellows at Columbia. Some things I did through the program include:

* Participated in workshops on Leadership, Equity in STEM, Conflict Resolution, Science Writing & Public speaking.
* Presented at the AAS 240 Splinter Session: Cultivating the Next Generation of Leaders in Pasadena, CA.
* Organized summer undergraduate research orientation in Columbia’s Astronomy department and co-led a workshop on coding in Python. 
* Co-founded *STEM Interdepartmental Lunch Series at Columbia*: a new monthly event for STEM graduate students at Columbia to encourage 
discussions across different disciplines. 

## Mentorship 
I am a mentor to both undergraduate and early graduate students via mentorship programs in the Astronomy department and Women in Science at Columbia group. Throughout the years, I have had many mentors and I am always happy to pay it forward. Please feel free to reach out too!

## Women in Science at Columbia (WISC)
I’ve been involved with WISC both as a mentor and a board member. I have helped organize campus-wide events to help create a supportive community at Columbia and co-founded a new event series.

## Thomas J. Watson Fellowship
Prior to graduate school, I spent 9 months (cut short from 12 months due to COVID-19), as a [Thomas J. Watson](https://watson.foundation/fellowships/tj) fellow. My project was titled: “Looking Up:
Exploring Skywatching Cultures” and took place in New Zealand, U.K, Peru, Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil. I conducted interviews, participated in astronomy events, visited astronomical sites, volunteered, and gave presentations. I wrote an article about it for the [Planetarian](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.ips-planetarium.org/resource/resmgr/planetarian/202009planetarian.pdf) (p.20-25); abridged version in the [Colgate Magazine](https://news.colgate.edu/magazine/2021/02/09/marveling-at-the-universe-together/). My personal + project blog can also be found [here](https://watson.alinasabyr.com/).
